This project is a Python-based data visualization dashboard that fetches 5-day weather forecast data using the OpenWeatherMap API and presents it in an interactive web application built with Streamlit. The project includes a script to fetch and process weather data, and a dashboard that allows users to input any city name and view the forecast. It features real-time data fetching through a public API, a line plot of temperature vs time created using Matplotlib, and a data table displaying detailed forecast information. The application runs locally and can be accessed through a web browser at localhost:8501.

Command to run this file (using terminal): python m- streamlit run task1.py
